# MusicBot-mpv

Provides [MusicBot](https://github.com/BjoernPetersen/MusicBot) playback for various formats
by using the [mpv](https://mpv.io) player.

If you have youtube-dl installed alongside mpv, this plugin can also play YouTube videos.
For that purpose, it implements the `YouTubePlaybackFactory` interface defined in
the [MusicBot-YouTube](https://github.com/BjoernPetersen/MusicBot-YouTube) project.

Please make sure you have the `mpv` command in your `PATH`.
